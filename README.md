## Branching Model

### Active Branches

| Branch          | Status                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [master](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/)                   | Accepts PRs from `develop` when intending to deploy to production.                  |
| [develop](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/)                 | Accepts PRs that are compatible with `master` OR from `release/X.X.X` branches.                    |
| release/X.X.X                                                                          | Accepts PRs for all changes, particularly those not backwards compatible with `develop` and `master`. |

### Overview

This repository generally follows [this Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Please read the linked post if you're planning to make frequent PRs into this repository.

### Production branch

The production branch is `master`.
The `master` branch contains the code for latest "stable" releases.
Updates from `master` **always** come from the `develop` branch.

### Development branch

The primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with the latest experimental [network deployments](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/).
If you're making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible and SHOULD be made against a release candidate branch**.
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a release candidate branch has already been fully deployed.
If you're changing or adding a contract and you're unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using the latest release candidate branch.
See below for info about release candidate branches.

### Release candidate branches

Branches marked `release/X.X.X` are **release candidate branches**.
Changes that are not backwards compatible and all changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` MUST be directed towards a release candidate branch.
Release candidates are merged into `develop` and then into `master` once they've been fully deployed.
We may sometimes have more than one active `release/X.X.X` branch if we're in the middle of a deployment.
See table in the **Active Branches** section above to find the right branch to target.

## Releases

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to mark packages for new releases.
When merging commits to the `develop` branch you MUST include a changeset file if your change would require that a new version of a package be released.

To add a changeset, run the command `yarn changeset` in the root of this monorepo.
You will be presented with a small prompt to select the packages to be released, the scope of the release (major, minor, or patch), and the reason for the release.
Comments within changeset files will be automatically included in the changelog of the package.

### Triggering Releases

Releases can be triggered using the following process:

1. Create a PR that merges the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.
2. Wait for the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR to be opened (may take several minutes).
3. Change the base branch of the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR from `master` to `develop` and merge into `develop`.
4. Create a second PR to merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.

After merging the second PR into the `master` branch, packages will be automatically released to their respective locations according to the set of changeset files in the `develop` branch at the start of the process.
Please carry this process out exactly as listed to avoid `develop` and `master` falling out of sync.

**NOTE**: PRs containing changeset files merged into `develop` during the release process can cause issues with changesets that can require manual intervention to fix.
It's strongly recommended to avoid merging PRs into develop during an active release.
